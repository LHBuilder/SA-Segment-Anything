# SA Segment Anything (SA2)
## SA2: Vision-Oriented MultiModal AI


SA2 integrates SOTA (state-of-the-art) models and provides a vision-oriented multi-modal framework. It's not an LLM (large-language model), but comprises multiple large-scale models, some of which are built on top of cutting-edge foundation models.

## Purposes

## Installation

The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.
