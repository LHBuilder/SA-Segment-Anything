# Faster Segment Anything(MobileSAM)

Demo of official PyTorch implementation of [MobileSAM](https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM).


**MobileSAM** performs on par with the original SAM (at least visually) and keeps exactly the same pipeline as the original SAM except for a change on the image encoder.
Specifically, we replace the original heavyweight ViT-H encoder (632M) with a much smaller Tiny-ViT (5M). On a single GPU, MobileSAM runs around 12ms per image: 8ms on the image encoder and 4ms on the mask decoder. 

## To run on local PC
First, mobile_sam must be installed to run on pc. Refer to [Installation Instruction](https://github.com/dhkim2810/MobileSAM/tree/master#installation)

Then run the following

```
python app.py
```

## License
